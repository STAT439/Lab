#### Part 1. Logistic Regression with a categorical predictor

Following the thread from the activity on Tuesday, we will consider a case where we have a binary outcome and a categorical predictor with three levels.

There are two formulations of this model, the first is known as the reference case model. In this formulation the $\beta$ coefficients correspond to differences from the reference case class.

\begin{align*}
y & \sim Bernoulli(\pi) \\
\pi & = \frac{\exp(\beta_0 + \beta_1 I_{x =1} + \beta_2 I_{x =2})}{1 + \exp(\beta_0 + \beta_1 I_{x =1}+ \beta_2 I_{x =2)}\\
\pi & = logit^{-1}(\beta_0 + \beta_1 I_{x =1}+ \beta_2 I_{x =2)\\
\end{align*}

The second is the cell means model which can more directly estimate probabilities associated with each class.

\begin{align*}
y & \sim Bernoulli(\pi) \\
\pi & = \frac{\exp(\beta_0 I_{x = 0}+ \beta_1 I_{x = 1} + \beta_2 I_{x =2)}{1 + \exp(\beta_0 I_{x = 0}+ \beta_1 I_{x =1}+ \beta_2 I_{x =2)}\\
\pi & = logit^{-1}(\beta_0I_{x = 0} + \beta_1 I_{x =1}+ \beta_2 I_{x =2)\\
\end{align*}



### 1. Data Simulation (6 points)

Use the cell means model and simulate data with the following properties

- Let there be a total of 150 observations, 50 from `x = "1"`, 50 from $x = ``2"$, and 50 from $x = ``3"$.


- Set the coefficient values to the following values:$\beta_0$ = 0, $\beta_1 = 1$, and $\beta_2 = -1$.


- Simulate a binary outcome at each x value. 


- Create a plot that displays the pi values along with observed binary responses.


### 2. Contingency Table (6 points)

Using your simulated data, print a contingency table and determine whether you'd detect any association between the two variables (binary outcome and categorical predictor).




### 3. Model fitting (6 points)

Fit your data using either an MLE or Bayesian approach, report point estimates and uncertainty intervals for the beta values. Hint, you can get the cell means coding with `y ~ x - 1`


### 4. Probability Scale (6 points)

With this model framework, we can also directly estimate uncertainty intervals for the probabilities using $\pi = logit^{-1}(\beta)$. Compute uncertainty intervals for the probability of success for each class and add them to an updated version of the figure from part 1.



### 5. Alternative Models (6 points)

Why do the two models below give you incorrect results?

```{r}
#| eval: false
model.fit <- glm(y ~ as.numeric(x) - 1, data = log_data, family = binomial)
model.fit <- glm(y ~ x - 1, data = log_data)

```
