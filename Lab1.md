# Lab 1


#### Question 1.

Given what we observed in the class activity it seems unlikely that MSU
and the University of Montana are evenly matched in football. Let’s
assume that outcomes of football games can be modeled with a binomial
distribution where $\pi = \frac{3}{4}$

##### 1.1 Explain - to a football fan - what $\pi$ means. (2 points)

##### 1.2 Estimate the probability that MSU won 6 of 8 games. (2 points)

##### 1.3 Estimate the probability that UM won 6 of 8 games. (2 points)

##### 1.4 Create a figure to show the probability that MSU won 0, 1, …, 8 (2 points)

##### 1.5 Simulate the next ten games in the series, how many did MSU win? (2 points)

#### Question 2.

At the start of class today, everyone rolled a die and recorded the
value on the marker board.

##### 2.1 What statistical probability distribution can be used to model these outcomes? (2 points)

##### 2.2 What are are the parameters in the distribution stated in the answer to q 2.1? (2 points)

##### 2.3 Create a figure that shows the outcomes of these rolls. (2 points)

##### 2.4 Create a figure that shows the likelihood of rolling a 6. (2 points)

##### 2.5 Calculate the MLE of rolling a 6 along with an uncertainty interval. (2 points)

##### 2.6 Do you think it is likely that the probability of rolling a 6 is \$? Why or why not? (2 points)

##### 2.7 What would be your best guess for the MLEs for all parameters in the model? (2 points)

##### 2.8 Do you think it is likely that we are using fair dice (equal probability of rolling any number)? Why or why not? (2 points)
